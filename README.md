Extremely minimal book tracker app written in React.

Dark mode!!!

## Development

The frontend React app lives in the `frontend` directory. After installing dependencies with `npm install`, run the development server with:

```bash
npm start
```

This uses `react-scripts` to serve the app on localhost.
